## Description
- A weather dashboard which displays current weather and forecast for a searched city. Users can search for a city, and if found the app will return the current weather, as well as a forecast of the next 5 days. The user's search history is saved as a button for them to quickly check the weather of that city again.
- Following the requirements, I created the code in HTML and JavaScript trying to have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
- I commented each step creating the code for futures developers understand.
